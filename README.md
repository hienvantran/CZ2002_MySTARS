## CZ2002_MySTARS

My Student Automated Registration System (MySTARS) is an university application meant for both undergraduate students and the admin staff. There are two modes: administrator mode for academic staff and user mode for students. MySTARS application can be used for key features such as creating courses and adding student records as well as course registration.

This project is a console-based application and written in Java. We applied the OOP concepts and design principles to model the application. The UML Class Diagram and UML Sequence Diagram for one feature will be used to illustrate the design. In addition, several test cases will be considered to show that the application will meet all requirements (for more specific, please see the report).
